Code does not always run top-to-bottom; decisions and repetition allow programs to adapt.</li> <li>Functions break problems into smaller, reusable pieces. A function packages code so it can be called multiple times without repetition.</li> <li>Algorithms are step-by-step solutions to problems. Before writing code, you plan the logic.</li> <li>Testing and debugging verify correctness. Programs must be tested systematically; errors are normal and expected.</li> <li>Data structures organize information. Lists and dictionaries store collections of related data efficiently.</li> <li>Iteration (loops) and conditionals enable user input and decision-making.

You discover user needs through interviews, surveys, or observation—not assumptions.</li> <li>Accessibility is not optional; it is ethical and required. Design must work for all users, including those with disabilities.</li> <li>Visual hierarchy guides attention. Size, color, and spacing signal what is important; users see them in order.</li> <li>Consistency reduces cognitive load. Users learn patterns (button placement, color use, navigation structure). Inconsistency is frustrating.</li> <li>Usability is measurable. You test designs with real users and iterate based on feedback, not personal preference.</li> <li>Responsive design adapts to different devices. The same design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.</li> <li>Color, typography, and whitespace have psychological effects.

CSS controls colors, fonts, spacing, and layout without changing the HTML.</li> <li>JavaScript is interactivity. JavaScript responds to user actions (clicks, input) and changes the page dynamically.</li> <li>Separation of concerns – Keep HTML, CSS, and JavaScript separate. Each has one job.</li> <li>Responsive design requires planning. Mobile-first thinking shapes HTML structure and CSS media queries from the start.</li> <li>Accessibility must be coded. HTML tags, alt text, color contrast, and keyboard navigation are accessibility foundations.</li> <li>The browser renders top-to-bottom and left-to-right by default. Understanding layout requires understanding how browsers interpret CSS.</li> <li>Testing across devices and browsers is mandatory.
