# Unit 1: Web Design & UX Principles

This unit prepares you for **AS91901 – Web Design**, a 4-week internal assessment focused on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design.

---

## Unit Overview

You will learn to:
- understand user needs and research methods
- design websites that are accessible and usable for everyone
- create wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes
- test your designs with real users
- iterate and improve based on evidence

By the end of this unit, you will have designed a functional, accessible website prototype backed by evidence of user testing and iterative improvement.

## Topics in This Unit

- [1. User Research & Personas](01_user-research-and-personas.md) — Understanding who you're designing for
- [2. Information Architecture & Wireframing](02_information-architecture-wireframing.md) — Structuring information and sketching layouts
- [3. Visual Design Principles](03_visual-design-principles.md) — Colour, typography, layout, and visual hierarchy
- [4. Accessibility & WCAG Compliance](04_accessibility-wcag.md) — Designing for everyone, including people with disabilities
- [5. Prototyping & Tools](05_prototyping-tools.md) — Creating digital mockups and interactive prototypes
- [6. User Testing & Usability Evaluation](06_user-testing-usability.md) — Testing your designs with real users

## How This Unit Relates to Assessment

**AS91901 – Web Design** requires you to submit:

1. **Wireframes or sketches** documenting your design evolution (at least 2 iterations)
2. **High-fidelity prototype** demonstrating visual design, layout, and interaction
3. **User testing evidence** from at least 3 real users
4. **Design iteration journal** showing changes made in response to feedback
5. **Accessibility checklist** verifying WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
6. **Design walkthrough** where you explain your decisions and reasoning

This unit's topics directly map to these requirements:

- Topics 1–2 prepare you for wireframes and structure
- Topics 3, 5 prepare you for high-fidelity prototypes
- Topics 4 prepare you for accessibility requirements
- Topics 6–7 prepare you for user testing and iteration evidence

---

## Key Concepts to Master

By the end of this unit, you must understand and be able to explain:

- **User-centred design:** Why designing for users, not for yourself, leads to better outcomes
- **Information architecture:** How to organize content so users can find what they need
- **Visual hierarchy:** How to use size, colour, and contrast to guide user attention
- **Accessibility:** Why universal design benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities
- **Testing and evidence:** Why user testing reveals problems that designers miss
- **Iteration:** How feedback loops create better designs than one-shot efforts
- **Design rationale:** Why you made specific choices and how they serve user needs

---

## Important Assessment Reminders

### Continuous Formative Checkpoints

Your teacher will collect evidence weekly:
- Design sketches and iterations
- User testing notes and feedback summaries
- Design rationale explanations
- Progress in your iteration journal

**This is not optional.** Formative checkpoints help you stay on track and give your teacher visibility into your thinking.

### Live Design Critique

Before final submission, you will participate in a **design critique session** where you:
- present your prototype to your teacher
- explain key design decisions and their rationale
- demonstrate how user testing informed your iterations
- justify accessibility compliance choices

Your teacher will ask questions like:
- *Why did you choose this colour scheme?*
- *How did this user's feedback change your layout?*
- *What accessibility principle does this feature address?*

If you can't explain your design, it's not valid evidence—no matter how professional the prototype looks.

### AI Use Restrictions (AS91901-Specific)

- ✗ AI-generated wireframes or mockups are not acceptable as final evidence
- ✗ AI-generated user feedback or testing summaries are not acceptable
- ✓ AI tools may help you understand concepts (e.g., "explain colour contrast ratios")
- ✓ AI tools may suggest colour palettes or design inspiration (must be cited)
- ✓ AI tools may verify accessibility (e.g., contrast checkers)

---

## Timeline (Indicative)

- **Week 1:** User research, personas, information architecture sketches
- **Week 2:** Initial wireframes, prototyping tool introduction, first prototype draft
- **Week 3:** User testing (recruit testers, conduct sessions, summarize feedback)
- **Week 4:** Design iteration, accessibility verification, final prototype, documentation

---

## Tools You'll Use

Recommended tools for wireframing and prototyping:
- **Figma** (free tier available; cloud-based; collaborative)
- **Adobe XD** (student access via school)
- **InVision** (prototyping and collaboration)
- **Pencil Project** (open-source; desktop-based)
- **Hand-drawn wireframes with digital annotation** (acceptable and often faster)

Your teacher will demonstrate these tools; choose the one that works best for you.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Designing for yourself, not users:** Just because *you* like a design doesn't mean users can navigate it. Test with real users.
2. **Skipping wireframes:** Jumping straight to high-fidelity design wastes time. Wireframes are fast; use them to test structure before investing in visual design.
3. **Ignoring accessibility:** WCAG compliance is not optional; it's a minimum threshold. Don't leave it as an afterthought.
4. **Testing only classmates:** Your classmates know the design; they're biased. Test with people unfamiliar with your project.
5. **One-off iteration:** Feedback is not a checklist; iteration is a cycle. If you change one element, verify it doesn't break something else.
6. **No documentation:** Your teacher can't give you credit for thinking you didn't document. Keep an iteration journal from day one.
