# Reflection and Analysis

This unit focuses on **thinking about your work after it is completed**.

Reflection and analysis are not about retelling what you did.  
They are about explaining **why you made decisions** and **how those decisions affected the outcome**.

This unit directly supports **AS92007 – Reflective Analysis**.

---

## What Reflection Is For

Reflection helps you:
- show understanding of your design process
- explain decisions using evidence
- evaluate what worked and what didn’t
- demonstrate learning

Good reflection makes your thinking visible.

---

## Reflection vs Building

By this point in the course:
- your game is complete
- no new features are added
- no new development occurs

Reflection looks **backward**, not forward.

---

## Evidence-Based Reflection

Strong reflection is based on:
- your actual game
- your development evidence
- specific features and mechanics
- real changes you made

Generic statements are weak and risky.

---

## How This Unit Is Used

In AS92007, you will:
- write structured responses
- refer directly to your own game
- analyse your design process
- evaluate outcomes and limitations

Your reflection must be about **your work**, not a hypothetical project.

---

## Looking Ahead

Next, you will learn:
- what reflection really means
- the difference between description and analysis
- how to link decisions to outcomes clearly

Reflection rewards clarity, honesty, and evidence.
