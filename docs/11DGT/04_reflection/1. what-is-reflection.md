# What Is Reflection?

Reflection is the process of **thinking critically about your work**.

In this course, reflection is not about storytelling or describing events in order.  
It is about explaining **decisions, changes, and outcomes**.

---

## Reflection Is Not Description

Simply stating what you did is **description**, not reflection.

Examples of description:
- “I made a platformer game.”
- “I added enemies.”
- “I fixed some bugs.”

These statements explain **what happened**, but not **why**.

## Reflection Involves Thinking About Decisions

Good reflection explains:
- why you chose a particular design
- why you changed something
- what problem you were trying to solve
- whether the change improved the outcome

Reflection focuses on **reasoning**, not actions.

---

## Using Evidence in Reflection

Strong reflection refers to:
- specific mechanics
- specific problems
- specific changes
- specific outcomes

Evidence might include:
- references to testing
- examples of player feedback
- descriptions of before-and-after behaviour

Vague reflection is weak reflection.

## Reflection and Learning

Reflection shows:
- what you learned during development
- how your thinking changed
- how mistakes led to improvement

Acknowledging limitations is not a weakness — it shows understanding.

---

## Reflection in Assessment

In AS92007, you are assessed on:
- how clearly you explain your design process
- how well you analyse decisions
- how effectively you evaluate outcomes

Being honest and specific is more important than claiming success.

## Looking Ahead

Next, you will learn:
- the difference between description and analysis
- how to move from “what” to “why”
- how to strengthen reflective responses

Reflection is about making your thinking visible.
