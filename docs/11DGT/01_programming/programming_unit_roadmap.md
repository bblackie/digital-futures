# Programming Unit Roadmap
**Year 11 Digital Technologies – AS92004**

This roadmap shows:
- what we are learning
- why it matters
- what evidence you are expected to produce

Programming is assessed on **understanding and explanation**, not just working code.

---

## Phase 1: Programming Foundations (Week 1)

### Focus
- What a computer program is
- Input → Process → Output (IPO)
- Sequencing and order of instructions

### Key Ideas
- Computers follow instructions exactly
- Order matters, even if code “runs”
- IPO helps structure thinking before coding

### In-Class Evidence
- IPO diagrams
- Written step-by-step logic
- Explanations of program flow

### Assessment
- **Formative Assessment 1: Program Logic & IPO**
  - Includes MCQs and written reasoning

---

## Phase 2: Program Structure (Week 2)

### Focus
- Variables and stored data
- Clear sequencing
- Readability and structure

### Key Ideas
- Structure shows clear thinking
- Messy code is harder to verify and debug
- Someone else should be able to follow your logic

### In-Class Evidence
- Annotated pseudocode
- Variable explanations
- Reordered or corrected logic examples

### Assessment
- Structure questions embedded in formative tasks
- Teacher checkpoints on clarity and explanation

---

## Phase 3: Control Structures (Week 3)

### Focus
- Selection (if / else)
- Iteration (loops)
- Combining control structures

### Key Ideas
- Selection chooses between paths
- Iteration repeats actions
- Many bugs come from incorrect conditions

### In-Class Evidence
- Plain-English conditions
- Loop reasoning without code
- Identification of logic bugs

### Assessment
- **Formative Assessment 2: Selection & Iteration**
  - MCQs + applied reasoning

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Debugging (Week 4)

### Focus
- Testing types (normal, edge, error)
- Debugging process
- Iterative improvement

### Key Ideas
- A running program is not automatically correct
- Testing shows understanding
- Small, explained fixes matter

### In-Class Evidence
- Test tables
- Error classification
- Explained fixes

### Assessment
- **Formative Assessment 3: Testing & Debugging**

---

## Phase 5: Summative Theory Verification (Week 5)

### Focus
- Holistic understanding of programming
- Explaining logic without code
- Transfer to unfamiliar scenarios

### Assessment
- **Summative Programming Theory Assessment**
  - MCQs
  - Diagrams
  - Scenario-based reasoning
  - Reflection

This assessment **supports and verifies** your AS92004 programming submission.

---

## Phase 6: AS92004 Programming Assessment (Weeks 5–6)

### Focus
- Independently develop a small Python program
- Demonstrate structure, logic, and testing

### Evidence Required
- Planning or pseudocode
- Intermediate versions
- Final program
- Reflection and explanations

You must be able to:
- explain your code
- justify decisions
- modify it live if asked

---

## End Goal

By the end of this unit, you should be able to:
- explain how your program works
- show how it was developed
- prove the work is your own
