# Programming Unit – Student Checklist
**AS92004: Develop a Computer Program**

Use this checklist to track your readiness.
If you cannot tick an item **confidently**, it is a risk.

---

## Foundations & Logic

☐ I can explain what a computer program is  
☐ I can identify input, process, and output in a program  
☐ I can explain why instruction order matters  
☐ I can describe program logic without writing code  

---

## Program Structure

☐ I can explain what variables are used for  
☐ I can name variables clearly and consistently  
☐ I can explain my program step by step  
☐ I can make my logic readable to someone else  

---

## Control Structures

☐ I can explain what selection is and why it is used  
☐ I can explain what iteration is and why it is used  
☐ I can describe what a condition checks  
☐ I can identify logic errors in decisions or loops  

---

## Testing & Debugging

☐ I can explain the difference between testing and debugging  
☐ I can write normal and edge test cases  
☐ I can explain what went wrong when a program fails  
☐ I can describe how I fixed an error and why  

---

## Assessment Readiness (Critical)

☐ I have planning or pseudocode  
☐ I have at least one intermediate version of my program  
☐ I can explain every part of my code  
☐ I can modify my code without AI help  
☐ I can justify design decisions  

---

## Evidence & Authenticity

☐ My work was developed mostly in class  
☐ I kept drafts and failed attempts  
☐ My explanations match my code quality  
☐ I am confident I could explain my work verbally  

---

## Final Self-Check

If asked right now, I could:

☐ Explain how my program works  
☐ Explain why I used each control structure  
☐ Explain how I tested it  
☐ Explain how I fixed a problem  

If any box is unticked, **address it before submission**.
