# Managing Scope

Scope refers to **what your game includes** and, just as importantly, **what it does not include**.

Managing scope is one of the most important skills in game development.

---

## What Is Scope?

Scope includes:
- the number of mechanics in your game
- the number of levels or scenes
- the complexity of interactions
- the amount of content to build

Scope determines how realistic your project is within the available time.

---

## Why Scope Matters

Poor scope management often leads to:
- unfinished features
- unstable games
- rushed submissions
- missing evidence

Good scope management leads to:
- complete and playable games
- fewer bugs
- clearer iteration
- stronger assessment outcomes

---

## Common Scope Problems

Common mistakes include:
- adding too many mechanics
- constantly changing the game idea
- starting new features late in development
- rebuilding instead of refining

These problems often reduce quality instead of improving it.

---

## Strategies for Managing Scope

Effective strategies include:
- starting with a simple core mechanic
- finishing features before adding new ones
- removing ideas that do not support the purpose
- prioritising stability over novelty

A small, well-made game is better than a large, unfinished one.

---

## Scope and Iteration

Iteration should:
- improve existing mechanics
- fix problems
- refine the player experience

Iteration should **not**:
- expand scope unnecessarily
- introduce new untested systems
- restart development late in the process

---

## Scope and Assessment

In AS92005:
- scope creep is not rewarded
- stability and clarity matter more than size
- justified decisions carry more weight than feature count

Choosing not to add a feature can be a **good design decision**.

---

## Looking Ahead

Next, you will learn:
- how to analyse your design process
- how to reflect on decisions and outcomes
- how to explain what worked and what didn’t

Managing scope makes reflection clearer and more defensible.
