# Game Development Unit – Roadmap  
**Year 11 Digital Technologies (AS92005)**

This roadmap shows the expected progression through the Game Development unit.
Progression is based on **evidence produced**, not time spent.

---

## Phase 1 — Understanding Games as Systems

**Focus**
- What makes something a game
- Games as interactive systems
- Player input, rules, feedback, outcomes

**Learning outcomes**
- Explain what makes a game
- Identify missing or weak game elements
- Describe the player–game feedback loop

**Core evidence**
- Handwritten explanations
- Annotated diagrams
- Formative theory check

---

## Phase 2 — Game Engines and Tools (Godot)

**Focus**
- What a game engine does
- Why Godot is used
- Project structure and files

**Learning outcomes**
- Explain the role of a game engine
- Describe the parts of a Godot project
- Explain what GDScript is used for

**Core evidence**
- Written explanations
- Project structure sketches
- Vocabulary checks

---

## Phase 3 — Structure: Scenes, Nodes, and Scripts

**Focus**
- How Godot organises games
- Relationship between scenes, nodes, and scripts
- Reuse and organisation

**Learning outcomes**
- Explain the difference between scenes, nodes, and scripts
- Justify why structure matters
- Plan a game structure before coding

**Core evidence**
- Scene/node planning sheets
- Tables linking structure to behaviour
- Discussion-based activities

---

## Phase 4 — Game Mechanics

**Focus**
- What mechanics are
- Cause-and-effect relationships
- Player experience

**Learning outcomes**
- Identify and describe mechanics
- Explain how mechanics affect the player
- Recognise good vs poor mechanics

**Core evidence**
- Mechanics breakdown sheets
- Edge-case discussions
- Formative theory check

---

## Phase 5 — Planning the Game

**Focus**
- Intentional design
- Scope control
- Clear purpose

**Learning outcomes**
- Define the purpose of the game
- Plan scenes, mechanics, and outcomes
- Justify design decisions

**Core evidence**
- Handwritten plans
- Scene diagrams
- Design justifications

---

## Phase 6 — Building and Testing

**Focus**
- Implementing mechanics
- Testing behaviour
- Identifying bugs and issues

**Learning outcomes**
- Build mechanics incrementally
- Test and explain behaviour
- Identify problems clearly

**Core evidence**
- Versioned code
- Testing notes
- Teacher checkpoints

---

## Phase 7 — Iteration and Improvement

**Focus**
- Responding to testing and feedback
- Improving playability
- Refining mechanics

**Learning outcomes**
- Explain what changed and why
- Justify improvements
- Show progression over time

**Core evidence**
- Iteration reflections
- Before/after comparisons
- Annotated screenshots

---

## Phase 8 — Finalisation and Explanation

**Focus**
- Explaining the finished game
- Verifying understanding
- Preparing assessment submission

**Learning outcomes**
- Explain how the game works
- Describe mechanics clearly
- Justify design and iteration decisions

**Core evidence**
- Summative theory assessment
- Final artefact
- Oral verification (if required)
